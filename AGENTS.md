# Follow-ups

## P2 — WinSCP temporary key files are only cleaned up by `TempPath` drop

- `src-tauri/src/winscp/key.rs:24` — `ConvertedKey::path` is a `tempfile::TempPath`;
  the file is deleted only when the handle is dropped.
- `src-tauri/src/winscp/launch.rs:57-62` — `launch_with` holds both converted keys for
  the duration of the call, and `run_process` (`launch.rs:108-117`) uses `Command::status`,
  which blocks until the spawned WinSCP process exits. Cleanup therefore depends on that
  wait returning.
- `src-tauri/src/commands/app.rs:383-392` — `app_quit` calls `app.exit(0)` immediately.
  Exiting Tabby RS before WinSCP closes kills the pending `spawn_blocking` task, so the
  `TempPath` never drops and the converted keys stay in the temp directory.
- Before WinSCP acceptance is signed off: implement and verify cleanup on application exit
  and on crash recovery, without deleting key files that another process is still using.
- `src-tauri/src/winscp/prepare.rs` also stages a source key while waiting for
  `WinSCP.com /keygen`; include that conversion phase in the cleanup verification.
- Also open: the existing-instance hand-off is unverified. `launch.rs:4-9` notes that a
  running WinSCP may take the session over, so the only process lifetime relied on is the one
  this module waits for. That path needs Windows evidence.

## Pending — WinSCP reuse of SSH keys and prompted passphrases

- `tabby-tauri/src/ssh/session.ts` can authenticate with keys from
  `ssh.listPrivateKeys` when the profile has no configured keys.
- `tabby-tauri/src/services/winscp.service.ts` converts only configured keys, so
  such sessions open WinSCP without a key. Verify this flow against the fixed
  upstream baseline before claiming WinSCP parity.
- Private-key prompts now offer Remember and save the passphrase after the native
  decoder unlocks the key. WinSCP conversion reads saved passphrases; verify reuse
  on Windows and compare unchecked Remember behavior with upstream before acceptance.

## Pending — full-repo lint fails on `tabby-local/src/session.ts`

- `yarn lint --format unix` fails with 1 problem:
  `tabby-local/src/session.ts:67:24: Unnecessary parentheses around expression. [Error/@typescript-eslint/no-extra-parens]`
- `HEAD` and the working tree match for this file (`git diff HEAD -- tabby-local/src/session.ts`
  is empty), so the failure is pre-existing.
- Unrelated to the current WinSCP/SSH changes; still pending.

## Pending — SSH forwarding desktop and Windows acceptance

- Renderer and native request tests cover selecting a forwarding socket independently
  of password, private-key, and keyboard-interactive login.
- `src-tauri/src/ssh/engine_integration.rs` verifies unsolicited agent and X11 channels
  against a loopback SSH server, with password/private-key login and forwarding on/off.
  The production forwarding helpers reject disabled channels before connecting to the
  local socket. Actual Tauri handler wiring, desktop controls, and multi-hop forwarding
  still need end-to-end acceptance.
- `src-tauri/src/ssh/engine.rs` now shares `connect_agent` with jump authentication and
  forwarding. On Windows, `None` selects Pageant and an explicit path selects a named pipe.
  Verify Pageant with `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` set and verify named-pipe connections on Windows.
- Local `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` stops in the `ring` dependency
  because the host lacks Windows C headers (`assert.h`). It does not establish that the
  Windows application code compiles; Windows compilation and runtime checks are pending.

## Pending — X11 transport parity and desktop acceptance

- Forwarding `ssh.x11Display` into the native request does not complete X11 parity.
  `server_channel_open_x11` still closes the channel on non-Unix hosts.
- `connect_x11_display` always adds 6000 to numeric display values; upstream
  `X11Socket.resolveDisplaySpec` treats values of 100 or greater as raw TCP ports.
- Verify the SSH close confirmation in the real desktop UI and validate agent/X11
  behavior on the supported operating systems before accepting complete parity.

## Pending — SSH password prompts and automatic authentication parity

- Configured profile passwords are now tried in automatic and explicit password modes.
  Native tests verify rejection falls through to stored passwords and Debug redacts the
  supplied value. Repeated configured/stored passwords are tried only once. Renderer
  tests cover ordering and separate jump-host passwords; manual macOS desktop loopback
  checks verify both modes authenticate with the configured password.
  Keyboard-interactive now tries a configured-password candidate before the stored
  or bare candidate. Only masked password fields receive prefill. Native code snapshots
  saved passwords after resolving the account, preserving the retry values if the panel
  saves a different password. Tests cover Keychain/Vault target isolation, equal/different
  configured and stored values, empty credentials, wire compatibility, and Debug redaction.
  macOS desktop direct and single-hop target connections verify a rejected configured
  password followed by a successful manual second candidate, with blank verification-code
  fields. Saved-password retry still needs desktop acceptance: this run's synthetic
  Keychain credential triggered SecurityAgent access approval, which desktop tools cannot
  operate. The test credential was removed and its absence verified.
- Automatic authentication now probes none and follows the server's non-empty allowed
  method lists. Unused candidates remain available if a later response enables them.
  Direct and jump connections share the same transport authentication adapter. Real SSH
  loopback tests cover password-only servers, method changes, and successful none auth.
  The password-retry fixture explicitly advertises password after rejection; its previous
  default russh rejection removed that method despite expecting another password attempt.
  Empty method lists preserve the last advertised list, but russh 0.54.4 closes the
  connection on an empty list; compare that transport behavior with upstream before
  accepting the empty-list edge case as complete parity.
- Keyboard-interactive challenges with no prompts now receive an empty response
  automatically, matching `14e2d60:tabby-ssh/src/session/ssh.ts`. Unit tests cover
  repeated empty rounds, rejection/fallback, non-empty prompts, and transport errors.
  Loopback integration tests cover acceptance and rejection after two empty rounds.
  Direct and single-hop macOS desktop connections verify two automatic rounds
  followed by a two-field challenge and successful login.
- Tauri keyboard-interactive authentication now uses the upstream inline panel with
  unchanged template and styles. Native metadata supplies the actual host, port, and
  resolved account for stored-password lookup and saving. Renderer tests cover field
  navigation, consent, storage errors, duplicate events, cancellation, stale sessions,
  and initial connection failure. An independent review's failure-cleanup finding is
  fixed and regression-tested. macOS desktop checks verify Enter, previous/next/finish,
  masked and echoed fields, Keychain saving, restart prefill, and reuse through a jump
  host. The synthetic Keychain entry and test servers were cleaned up afterward.
  Vault, keyboard-interactive authentication on the jump host itself, other supported
  platforms, and saved-password retry behavior still need acceptance. Preserve
  upstream's save-on-consent behavior when aligning rejected-password deletion below.
- Empty usernames now prompt after host-key verification; `$VAR` expands before
  authentication and saved-password lookup. Native tests cover cancellation, invalid
  responses, environment fallback, and Keychain/Vault identity isolation. Manual macOS
  desktop checks verify visible username input, Enter, Esc without an auth attempt,
  environment expansion, and Keychain password reuse under the resolved username.
  A single-hop desktop check verifies distinct hop/target usernames and target Keychain
  reuse. A four-hop macOS desktop check verifies each hop's username prompt and configured
  password, second-hop cancellation, and cleanup without disturbing another connection.
  Vault desktop behavior and other platforms still need acceptance.
- Private-key passphrases now use the shared masked prompt with Remember and retry.
  Renderer tests cover cancellation, consent, retries, stale events, and storage errors.
  A manual macOS desktop loopback check verifies wrong-then-correct passphrase entry and
  successful key authentication. Reading the isolated synthetic Keychain entry verifies
  the remembered value. A second manual macOS desktop check verifies reuse after restarting
  the app and Esc cancellation followed by successful configured-password fallback.
  Vault, jump-host flows, and other supported platforms still need acceptance.
- Missing/unreadable and malformed private keys now fall through to later methods.
  Unit and loopback tests cover this behavior, including successful password fallback.
  Desktop jump-host acceptance still needs verification.
- Automatic and explicit password modes now use the shared `PromptModalComponent`.
  Browser checks cover masked input, Remember, Enter, OK, and Esc with simulated native
  events. A manual macOS desktop loopback SSH check verifies actual prompt delivery, Enter
  authentication, terminal output, and Esc cancellation without a password attempt.
  A manual macOS desktop check also verifies Remember creates a Keychain credential that
  a subsequent resolved-username connection can reuse. Password prompts on jump hosts,
  Vault persistence, and other platforms still need end-to-end acceptance.
- Independent review covers private-key loading/passphrase prompts, configured-password
  reuse, and resolved-username prompts/lookups. Broader agent/stored-password and prompted-
  password review remains pending. The native passphrase retry loop has manual desktop
  evidence but no automated regression test. Complete these checks before accepting
  SSH authentication parity.

## Pending — SSH credential and username follow-through

- Jump chains now connect outermost first, without the former three-hop limit, and use
  effective profile settings including group defaults and built-in profiles. Renderer
  tests cover 0/1/2/3/4/8 hops, credential association, cycles, missing profiles,
  and profile resolution. Native validation checks every hop. A four-hop macOS desktop
  connection using inherited group settings succeeds; closing its tab leaves no open
  connections on the five loopback servers. Built-in profile desktop behavior, mixed
  authentication methods, forwarding, and other platforms still need acceptance.

- `tabby-tauri/src/services/winscp.service.ts` uses the original profile username for
  jump options, matching `14e2d60:tabby-ssh/src/services/ssh.service.ts`. Verify prompted
  and `$VAR` accounts on Windows against that baseline before classifying a parity gap.
- `tabby-tauri/src/services/passwordStorage.service.ts` omits the port from the Keychain
  service when the profile has no port, while native SSH lookup defaults to port 22.
  Verify legacy no-port profiles and preserve existing credentials when aligning the keys.
- Upstream `14e2d60:tabby-ssh/src/session/ssh.ts` deletes saved passwords after rejected
  authentication. Compare and implement the matching resolved-account behavior.
- Direct authentication shares a 120-second deadline across username, password, and key
  prompts; jump authentication does not share that deadline. Verify slow interactive
  login against upstream before accepting timeout parity.
